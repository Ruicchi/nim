# What I learned from my first three years of college

To be honest, I don't know what to feel. It's like having that rollercoaster ride that leaves you feeling retchy because you were so excited and didn't sleep the night before. It's kinda epic in the sense that, I signed up for this. I knew I was going to feel nauseous, but it was quite... fun!

## The Good

School's pretty close to our home. Just nine railway stations away and 15 minutes of low-intensity cardio walk. Most of the time, I accompany or get accompanied by my fellow classmates when going home, so those 'short' walks would never be boring. 

On a different note, I really liked the perks that comes with the school email. Free Notion Education, Gemini AI Pro, Canva Education, and much more! It motivated me to use some tech that I don't regularly use because of these perks, and I never looked back.

But, the school projects, I think, are the highlight of my journey. Those brainstorming moments, and the study sessions with my comrads, are just really memorable. Looking back, those sleepless nights that just felt hopeless because of time constraints and strict deadlines, I have no idea why I stressed so much over those problems, but I'm glad all that effort really paid off.

## The Bad

It's **really** hot around the area. This is due to the dense concrete stones and asphalt infrastructure of Intramuros, combined with traffic congestion with the Philippines' naturally hot, humid tropical climate. You needed to invest in a top-grade sunscreen, especially if the season's UV index is too high.

While the school's technically close, there are some times that rush hours could turn the short trip into a stressful one. After a long day at school, the last thing you want is to deal with a crowded station. This made my simple travel mentally exhausting.

And I gotta admit, there were moments of academic pressure that went beyond 'challenging' and crossed into overwhelming. The constant need to perform well is draining, and at times, it felt like there was barely a room to breathe between requirements.

## The Plot Twist

Somewhere along the way, I realized that my college years wasn't just shaping my academic skills, or pushing me to get high grades. It was shaping me as a person. While I was busy meeting deadlines and surviving long school days, I also started learning things outside the classroom.

I learned to play the guitar. I started exploring a new language. I became more physically active, turning walks and workouts into a way to reset my mind. Reconnecting with my old friends. Having quality time with my lovely, supportive family. Slowly, I began building a more balanced life that I'm, genuinely proud of.

I believe this was largely possible because of how close our home is to the school, that I had the time to do all these kinds of things because of the short commute. It gave me something that many students struggle to find: time.
